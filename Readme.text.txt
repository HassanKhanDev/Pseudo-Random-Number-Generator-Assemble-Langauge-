PRNG Project - COE 301 Assignment

1. Overview
   - This project implements a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) using Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) in MIPS Assembly.
   - The generated random numbers are analyzed and plotted using Excel.

2. Project Structure
   - PRNG_Project/
     - Code/ (Contains MIPS (.asm) source files)
     - Plot/ (Contains Excel file + Graph Images)
     - README.txt (Project documentation)
     - prng_full_output.csv (Raw output data if needed)

3.  Run the Code
   - Open QtSPIM (MIPS Simulator).
   - Load the ASM files from the Code/ directory.
   - Run the program step by step or execute it completely.
   - Check the console output for generated random numbers.
   - Save the output and move it to the Plot/ folder for visualization.

4.  Generate Graph (Excel)
   - Open PRNG_Graph.xlsx from the Plot/ folder.
   - The sheet already contains the PRNG output data.
   - The graph is pre-generated for analysis.
   - Save the graph as an image (PNG/JPEG) if needed.

5. Notes
   - The LFSR PRNG algorithm is implemented for 8-bit and 16-bit registers.
   - Different seed values are used for multiple variations.
   - The output is stored in prng_full_output.csv for analysis.

6. Final Checklist
   - MIPS Code implemented (.asm files)
   - Output generated and saved (.csv file)
   - Graph plotted in Excel (.xlsx file)
   - Project documentation completed (README.txt)
